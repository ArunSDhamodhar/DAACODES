# DAACODES
i have used c because i have forgotten python and java, and as i have worked in c in the previous sem i found it easier to work in c
i have penalised all negative values to 100 and added the negative values as their positive counterparts
prims and kruskals will work for this case but wont work under generic conditions
in kruskals,prims we cant check for cycles,negative weights will be a problem because it will give false mst cost
we are modifying djikistra by converting negative values into positive values
